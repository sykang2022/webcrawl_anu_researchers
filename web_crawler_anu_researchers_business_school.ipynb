In a clinical trial, sometimes patients drop out. If a scientific measurement is recorded with error, then the true value is missing. Can we just ignore the missing data? Usually not because the missingness mechanism is related to other variables in our study.  I'm interested in using statistical methods to handle missing data, beyond ignoring the missing values. , Applied statistics, Some of the best theoretical and methodological research in statistics has come out of solving 'real' problems.
